# Calculator for beginners

This is a single python file that contains multiple mathematical functions that are being used in the form of a CLI calculator.
The functions are implemented using basic mathematical operations so that beginners to coding can learn how to implements mathematics in python.

The following are the implemented mathematical functions in this calculator:
 - Addition
	 - `def  add(x, y)`
 - Subtraction
	 - `def  subtract(x, y):`
 - Multiplication
	 - `def  multiply(x, y):`
 - Division
	 - `def  divide(x, y):`
 - LCM calculation
	 - `def  compute_lcm(x, y):`
 - HCF (GCD) calculation
	 - `def  compute_hcf(x, y):`
 - Power calculation
	 - `def  compute_power(base, exponent):`
 - Circle area calculation
	 - `def  area_of_circle(radius):`
 - Circle circumference calculation
	 - `def  circumference_of_circle(radius):`
 - Radian to degree conversion
	 - `def  radian_to_degree(radian):`
 - Degree to radian conversion
	 - `def  degree_to_radian(degree):`
 - Finding X using sine cosine and tangent
	 - `def  find_x_with_sin_cos_tan(opposite, hypotenuse, adjacent, angle):`
 - Finding a missing value using Pythagoras theorem
