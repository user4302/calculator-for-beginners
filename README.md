# Calculator for beginners

This is a single python file that contains multiple mathematical functions that are being used in the form of a CLI calculator.
The functions are implemented using basic mathematical operations so that beginners to coding can learn how to implements mathematics in python.

The following are the implemented mathematical functions in this calculator:
 - Addition
	 - `def  add(x, y)`
	 - adds x and y
 - Subtraction
	 - `def  subtract(x, y):`
	 - subtracts y from x
 - Multiplication
	 - `def  multiply(x, y):`
	 - multiplies x by y
 - Division
	 - `def  divide(x, y):`
	 - divides x by y
	 - y cannot be zero in order to get a value as an answer
 - LCM calculation
	 - `def  compute_lcm(x, y):`
	 - calculates the LCM of x and y
 - HCF (GCD) calculation
	 - `def  compute_hcf(x, y):`
	 - calculates the HCF (GCD) of x and y
 - Power calculation
	 - `def  compute_power(base, exponent):`
	 - calculates the value of the base to the power of the exponent
 - Circle area calculation
	 - `def  area_of_circle(radius):`
	 - calculates the area of a circle using its radius
 - Circle circumference calculation
	 - `def  circumference_of_circle(radius):`
	 - calculates the circumference of a circle using its radius
 - Radian to degree conversion
	 - `def  radian_to_degree(radian):`
	 - converts a radian to its degree equivalent
 - Degree to radian conversion
	 - `def  degree_to_radian(degree):`
	 - converts a degree to its radian equivalent
 - Finding X using sine cosine and tangent
	 - `def  find_x_with_sin_cos_tan(opposite, hypotenuse, adjacent, angle):`
	 - calculates the value of x which could be any one of opposite, hypotenuse, adjacent or angle, when at least 2 other values are given
	 - the value to be found should be entered as 'x' 
	 - the value that is not provided should be left blank
 - Finding a missing value using Pythagoras theorem
	 - `def  pythagoras_theorem(sideA, hypotenuse, sideB):`
	 - finds the length of a missing side, sideA, hypotenuse or sideB, when at least 2 of the values of the sides are given.
 - Square root calculation
	 - `def  square_root(number):`
	 - calculates the square root of any number
