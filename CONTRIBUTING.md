# Contribution Guidelines

all PRs that are submittd must be of good quality.
insignificant or spammy PRs will be rejected or labelled as spam and will not be counted towards your hacktoberfest PR count.

## Avoid Submitting Low-quality Pull/merge Requests

Hacktoberfest is about contributing meaningfully to open-source projects. Here are some examples of low-quality pull/merge requests that won’t count towards Hacktoberfest.

Automated pull/merge requests: scripted opening pull requests to remove whitespace, fix typos or optimize images.

- Disruptive pull/merge requests: taking someone else’s branch/commits and making a pull request.
- Anything that a project maintainer flags as spam.
- Anything that looks like an attempt to duplicate your pull request count for October.
- Multiple pull/merge requests for the same issue that are unnecessary -for example five PR/MRs to remove a stray whitespace is not.
